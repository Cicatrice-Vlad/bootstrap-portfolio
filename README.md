# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The portfolio is meant to be used as a guidance for the course that I currently am attending and it will showcase my personal progress throughout it.

- The main motivation for this project was to use Bootstrap for this project and see its functions in real life.
- I have built this project so that any person of concern can access it and have a look at my professional work.
- The project showcases clearly my current skills and the outcome that I expect of it after I finalize my course as well as future work that I hope to start practicing.
- I have understood that Bootstrap can be used for a lot of shortcuts in the Dev world but you also have to understand it for it to be used properly.


## Usage

The website has clear sections that can bring the viewer to the right spot on the webpage as well as opening new tabs for other projects on the browser once clicked.

Cards have been used for that matter as well as hyperlinks and buttons.
